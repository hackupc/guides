## Sponsor FAQ

### When to arrive?

If you have a stand for the event, we recommend you arrive between 13:00 and 15:00 to set up your stand on your location, the hackers will start arriving at 16:00 since the checkin for them starts at that moment. We recommend you to stay at least from when you arrive until hacking begins at noon.

If the person from your company will arrive just in time for the opening ceremony, they should directly go to the [Auditori Vertex](https://goo.gl/maps/vu1vfey5v8u) at 18:30.

### What do you do with swag?

Participants love company swag! If you have a table, feel free to bring it for your table.

### How can I join Slack?

When the event approaches we will send you an invitation link, so you can join the slack and start talking with the hackers! Once you enter the workspace, please set a profile picture so that Hackers recognize you. Your company will have its own channel ( **#company-name** ) where you can interact with hackers, but don't hesitate to show up in other general channels, if you want!

### Will there be food and drinks?

We will be providing all meals, snacks and drinks, and you are allowed to eat and drink anything at the event except alcoholic beverages! Feel free to bring your own food if you want, although we provide all kind of diet options so we have got you covered.
