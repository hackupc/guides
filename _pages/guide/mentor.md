---

First of all, in the name of the HackUPC team, we’d like to thank you for wanting to be a mentor. This event would not be complete without you. As a mentor, you will be **helping students work on projects, learn everything about a new technology, and come up with creative ideas**. Participants will then have 36 hours to work on any project they choose. HackUPC gives participants the resources, space, and time to create something amazing.

## Who is a mentor?

Mentors are experienced volunteers who want to share their knowledge with new hackers and help them get through different roadblocks. They help new hackers make their dreams a reality by aiding them during the event. However, mentors do **not** participate in the hackathon as hackers do and therefore, they can’t submit any project.

## Which are my responsibilities as a mentor?

During the event, we expect mentors to:

- **Act as helpers**, moving from group to group and helping hackers with any questions or roadblocks they have. However, keep in mind that mentors can’t submit a project nor contribute in a team’s project in a way that a project becomes mainly their work. Their task is to guide and help teams to carry on their own projects instead of actively contributing to the code.

- **Be present** most of the time. The hackathon starts at 9.00 P.M on Friday and ends
  at 9.00 A.M. on Sunday. It is not necessary to attend the whole event, but we
  encourage everyone to be highly available.

- **Check out help requests** through our communication channels:
  - Messages from the #mentors Slack channel

- **Follow the organisers rules**, at the end, they know the timing on the event and what is the best help in each moment.

- **Follow [HackUPC Rules](https://legal.hackersatupc.org/hackupc/terms_and_conditions)**, HackUPC it's only possible if we respect its rules, the event is prepared for the people we intive, even you! And it is only possible to make it out if we all contribute to it. Find the complete list of rules in our [live page](https://live.hackupc.com/rules).

You will receive all the details with respect to these tasks once you get to the hackathon.

### Different responsibilities at different times
As a mentor, your responsibilities will vary depending on the stage of the hackathon. Here is a breakdown of what you can expect:

At the start of the hackathon on **Friday night**, mentors will be responsible for helping participants set up their development environments and **git projects**. You will also be helping participants form teams, answering any questions they may have about the hackathon, and providing guidance on how to approach the hackathon challenges.

**During the hackathon**, mentors will be responsible for helping participants with any **technical issues** they may have. This could include helping them troubleshoot errors, providing guidance on how to use certain technologies, and proposing alternatives if a particular technology isn't working out. 

On **Sunday morning**, mentors will be responsible for helping participants **submit their projects to Devpost** and for helping them present their projects to the judges. You will be checking that everyone is capable of doing so, and ensuring that all projects are submitted on time. 

### What benefits do I get as a Mentor?

We want you to live a great hackathon experience. As a mentor, you will be able to:

- Attend workshops and tech talks that take place during the event.

- Access to the Lobby: a reserved area for volunteers and mentors where you can hang out and have some rest.
